Todo list for preimp_qc (to be renamed since we will be adding other features)
====

## In progress
- [ ] Fixing HWE annotation functions for cases and controls

## Todo

- [ ] Update report and preimp_qc.py sections to cater for different data types e.g. case-/control-only,
case-control, and trio data
- [ ] Add filter functions for handling trio dataset (mendel erros for IDs+SNPs and HWE p-value for SNPs)
- [ ] Add support for VCF files and include appropriate filter functions (also
